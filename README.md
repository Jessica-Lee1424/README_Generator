# README_Generator
Module 7 Assignment Repository

For our Module 7 assignment, I wanted to provide a thorough document of how to create a proper README.md, including a README.md generator that allows the user to quickly create a professional README.md when beginning a new project. Doing this will allow the user to set up their project more quickly and efficiently. In doing so, I have learned how to install package.JSON packages....

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

- Create your repository with desired .gitignore files added
- Navigate to repository in terminal
- install npm and package.JSON
......

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/files-screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
