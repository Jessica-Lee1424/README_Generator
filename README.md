This project is to demonstrate how to use Nodes prompts to autogenerate a detailed README.md file.
Successfully executing this will allow the user to generate a README from the terminal or command line.
Some problem spots were when initially generating the README, spaces were automatically inserted creating issues when viewing the readme. This was resolved by manually deleting the spaces in front of the sections.
In this process, I learned how to select a license and link it so that the badge icon displays. I also learned some styling tips in CSS for displaying the badge.
